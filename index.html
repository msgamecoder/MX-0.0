  <h1>📡 About MX API — Final Chapter</h1>
  <p style="line-height: 1.7rem; max-width: 800px;">
    Hello and welcome to the official hub of <strong>MX API 0.0</strong> — a project that started with pure curiosity and grew into something meaningful. 🌱💻<br><br>

    🧠 This API was handcrafted by <strong>MX-GΔMΞCØDΞR</strong> (a.k.a the mind behind MSWORLD) to serve as a free and open source toolkit for developers and learners around the world. It includes features like random jokes, status tests, documentation links, and more — all served via a clean RESTful interface. <br><br>

    🎁 <strong>Open Source & Free Forever</strong><br>
    Everything here is open to the public — no paywalls, no tricks. You can contribute, fork, remix, and use the code however you like.<br>

    🛠️ <strong>Created:</strong> From late-night coding and lots of debugging... MX API was born.<br>
    📅 <strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 10, 2025 — the final stable version.<br><br>

    ⚠️ <strong>Status: Legacy</strong><br>
    The MX API project is no longer under active development. But don’t be sad — the reason is beautiful. The creator has moved on to build something even greater: <strong>MSWORLD 🌍</strong>, a powerful new social platform built from scratch to connect the world in a fresh way.<br><br>

    💡 <strong>The Future?</strong><br>
    While MX API is in legacy mode, don’t be surprised if you see small updates or secret tweaks pop up from time to time. The repo is alive, and the spirit is eternal.<br><br>

    ❤️ <strong>From MX-GΔMΞCØDΞR:</strong><br>
    Thank you to everyone who ever used this API, tested an endpoint, or gave feedback. You made this journey worth it. I’m not quitting — I’m evolving. See you on MSWORLD! 💫<br><br>
